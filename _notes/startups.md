> The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.

### Startups, some thoughts...
- Re: recruiting - the world needs this, it won’t happen any time soon if we don’t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don’t join.
- Let yourself become more ambitious — figure out the most interesting version of where what you’re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step. You don’t want step one to be incorporating the company and step two to be going to Mars.
- Be willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you’re doing. Most people aren’t, which is part of the reason they pick “easy” startups. In a world of compounding advantages where most people are operating on a 3 year timeframe and you’re operating on a 10 year timeframe, you’ll have a very large edge.

> A good test for an idea is if you can articulate why most people think it’s a bad idea, but you understand what makes it good.

- Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.
- It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

- Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.

- Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.

- Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.

- Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.

- First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.
