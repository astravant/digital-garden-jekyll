title: Future
---

- Idea: the future is going to be different than the present, but it will be rooted in the present. I see the future as a set of potential paths, each with a different probability of becoming base reality based on our actions as a society and individually. 

  - If AI is capitalist, cryptocurrency is libertarian. 
  - I see the potential of an AI controlled human race
  - in many ways, our lives are significantly controlled via algorithms already

- Two potential paths - an AI controlled human race or a distributed, decentralized future. 
  - I think the answer may lie somewhere in the middle. Perhaps some algorithms are owned by a small group (likely) 
  - this is why I'm interested in the ideas of crowd-based capitalism, UBA, collectives. 
  
- More thoughts on the future of humanity. We will use chemicals e.g. SSRIs to control and maintain positive mental states. Algorithms will run most aspects of our lives. From the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the work we do, and even partially the way we are governed. 

- We need to get more people working on the sciences and building a better world. We must free up the world and work on the conversion problems that exist. Make a world that works for 100% of humanity. Working for others is working for yourself. Ask yourself what is most important to you, what you're good at, and optimize for that. 

- What truth do very few people agree with you on?
  - Mine = the narrative on work and why we spend our lives working even though we do not enjoy it. We need to do away with the idea of earning a living. The 40 hour work week. We have a narrative of work as a means to an end and profit maximization. We need to work for the process itself. This will become possible as we shift to higher value work.
