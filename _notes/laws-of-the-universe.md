# Laws of the Universe
#idea: Like Newton’s law of universal gravitation, there are immutable laws of the universe that govern our reality and life experience. When you understand these laws, you can shift your life in a very powerful way.

## Oneness 
- everything is connected to everything else. What we think, say, do and believe will have a corresponding effect on others and the universe around us.

## Vibration

- Everything in the Universe moves, vibrates and travels in circular patterns, the same principles of vibration in the physical world apply to our thoughts, feelings, desires and wills in the Etheric world. Each sound, thing, and even thought has its own vibrational frequency, unique unto itself.

## Action

- Must be employed in order for us to manifest things on earth. We must engage in actions that supports our thoughts dreams, emotions and words.

## Correspodance

- This Universal Law states that the principles or laws of physics that explain the physical world energy, Light, vibration, and motion have their corresponding principles in the etheric or universe "As above, so below"

## Compensation

- The Universal Law is the Law of Cause and effect applied to blessings and abundance that are provided for us. The visible effects of our deeds are given to us in gifts, money, inheritances, friendships and blessings.

## Perpetual Transmutation of Energy

- All persons have within them the power to change the conditions of their lives. Higher vibrations consume and transform lower ones; thus, each of us can change the energies in our lives by understanding the Universal Laws and applying the principles in such a way as to effect change

## Attraction

- The law states that… “we magnetically attract circumstances, events, and people that are in harmony with our dominant thoughts, emotions and patterns of self talk.” 
- “We attract into our lives that which we talk about most of the time.”

- The law states that you are the sculptor of your future and your ultimate life destiny; that you are the painter of your life’s canvas and experience; and that you are the architect of your life circumstances and attitude. 

## Cause and Effect

- “Change your actions, and you change your life...transform your thoughts, and you will create a brand new destiny.” 

- Your thoughts, behaviors, and actions create specific effects that manifest and create your life as you know it. If you are not happy with the effects you have created, then you must change the causes that created them in the first place. 

## Control

- “You feel good about yourself to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life.” - Brian Tracy

- When we are physically, mentally, and emotionally controlling the changes in our lives, this naturally leads to higher levels of achievement, emotional satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment. 
- While uncontrolled change leads to stress, anxiety, frustration and misery - all of which signifies that our mind lacks discipline, order, and structure. 

## Belief

- “You don't believe what you see, you rather see what you have already decided to believe.” 
- This has occurred time and time again in my life with family or close friends. They see something that is a pattern disrupt that they do not believe is possible so they simply dismiss it all together. They choose not to come to grips that they too could be in that position if they had taken control of their life and circumstances and made better decisions. 
- You have the power and control to do anything you want, if you are willing to make sacrifices and work hard. 

## Relativity

- Each person will receive a series of problems (Tests of Initiation/Lessons) for the purpose of strengthening the light within each of us. 
- These tests/lessons will be a challenge but remain connected to our hearts when proceeding to solve the problems. 
- This law also teaches us to compare our problems to others problem into its proper perspective. No matter how bad we perceive our situation to be, There is always someone who is in a worse position. It's all relative.

## Polarity

- Everything is on a continuum and has an opposite. We can suppress and transform undesirable thoughts by concentrating on the opposite pole. It is the law of mental vibrations.

## Rhythm

- Everything vibrates and moves to certain rhythms.. These rhythms establish seasons, cycles, stages of development, and patterns. Each cycle reflects the regularity of God's Universe. Masters know how to rise above negative parts of a cycle by never getting too excited or allowing negative things to penetrate their consciousness.
