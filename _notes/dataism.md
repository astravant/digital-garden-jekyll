title: The Data Religion
--- 

### Dataists believe we should hand over as much information and power to algorithms as possible, allowing the free flow of data to unlock innovation and progress unlike anything we’ve seen before.

> It is clear to me, the universe rewards systems which maximize the spread of information, ideas, and knowledge. 

#### All wealth is the product of knowledge, the more knowledge which exists in a society, the more successful it will be - we can nitpick this statement and clarify with 'organized knowledge.' As knowledge and information alone do not lead anywhere, or do they - a parallel to the butterfly effect here. 

#### **Data Religion** believes that the entire universe is a flow **of data** that organisms are algorithms, and that humanity's cosmic vocation is to create an all-encompassing **data**\-processing system – and then merge into it.
