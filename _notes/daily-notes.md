- [[Elon Musk]]
  - goal is to extend human consciousness as far as possible into the future so we can understand more about consciousness
  - to do so, we cannot stay on earth
- question: why can we not stay on earth
  - there will be a self-terminating event or natural event that ends human life in future
  - Elon's answer is to become a multi-planetary species and build cities on [[Mars]]
  - Other potential solutions to this problem include taking a look at physics
  
- [[biocentrism]] 
  - Concepts such as time, space, and even causality are increasingly being demonstrated as meaningless.
  - All of science is based on information passing through our consciousness but science hasn‚Äôt the foggiest idea what consciousness is, and it can‚Äôt explain the linkage between subatomic states and observation by conscious observers. 
  - Science describes life as a random occurrence in a dead universe but has no real understanding of how life began or why the universe appears to be exquisitely designed for the emergence of life.

- [[Daniel Schmachtenberger]]
  - Maximum polarization on both political sides
	  - ea. side believes if the other wins it will be the end of the republic of America
	  - we believe what feels true and what those around us choose to believe 
  - Since earliest large scale civilizations (Egypt and Sumeria) a very small percentage of these groups have been republics
	  - most are monarchies/top down systems 
	  - corporations are run this way as well, hierarchies 
  - democracies and republics typically follow a period of [[cultural enlightenment]]
	  - the people in the society are all educated and understand how the society works
	  - this creates the ability to collectively sensmake.

- [[podcasting]] 
  - spotify and apple increasing data available to advertisers
	- listen time, downloads, etc. 
	- podcasting has soared in 2020 
	- Why Spotify likes podcasting? They don't have to hand huge chunks of revenue over to record labels. 
  
- [[autonomous driving]] industry will likely submit to natural geographic monoplies due to the amount of location-specific driving data necessary to launch and have a winning platform. 
  - first movers will be able to collect more data thus increasing the likliehood of having a better platform. 
  
- [[Maxine]], a new AI powered video conferencing platform from [[Nvidia]]
  - how does it work? 
  - idea: transmit only key facial features instead of entire frames which uses only a tenth of the bandwidth 
  - use [[GAN's]] or [[Generative Adversarial Networks]] to convert the sparse facial features into photorealistic renderings.  
  
- [[Estonia]]
  - Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation with a population of only ~1.3 million people, is considered one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.
  - The world‚Äôs first e-government üá™üá™
  - The first country to launch a Digital Nomad Visa

  - The first country to hold nationwide elections using electronic voting 
  - The first country that Ikea first entered digitally before establishing a physical presence
  
- [[Genies]] has created an agency named [[Avatar Agency]] to represent the interests of celebrity digital doubles
  - Avatars don‚Äôt get tired, can ‚Äútravel‚Äù anywhere, and are available 24 hours a day.
  - idea As the next generation of consumers spend increasingly more of their lives in some form of a digital realm, 3D avatars will likely be everywhere.
  - idea Avatars are the next medium of expression, and 3D allows you to effectively operate and command virtual beings.

question: How big is the digital goods opportunity?
idea: I‚Äôm very bullish on digital goods. Take Fortnite: Last year, it sold $1B in avatar skins.



# October 21, 2020
- Very important to recognize the motives driving the actions of individuals and society
- Be willing to take a different path
  - reverse engineer your desires and motives to get at the root of what interests you and what you believe is important for the future of humanity. 
  - typically, we have a dozen or more motives driving our actions, we are personally only aware of half of them, and we only publicly share 2-3 of them. 
- Accept that the path for you will likely be dissimilar to the path pursued by the masses
- The path being followed by the masses is not always the right path, find the right path for you. 
- Success is at the intersection of your strenghts, a topic that excites you, and self belief. 
- Compare yourself to where you were yesterday, not to where someone else is today. 

- Question: do you build a personal brand, corporate brand, or neither? 
  - I do not intend to build a personal brand at the moment. 
  - However, I do believe it to be critical for certain discussions in society to take place.
  - If I see a lack of dialouge around a positive future, transparency, decentralization, etc. it may make sense to build a brand to share messages that I thinnk urgently need to be spread.
