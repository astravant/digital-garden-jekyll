> Human civilization is based on our full intellectual record - and our record should be as advanced as possible if society Is to be as advanced as possible.

# February 12, 2021
- Mission should not change; ideas can change, process can change - and these two should change. You should always be seeking to build a more effective and efficient machine for achieving the objectives of the organization.
	- This is your goal as CEO or leader of an organization - build a machine that outputs the objectives as effectively and efficiently as possible.

> “Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources. Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point, our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress.” – Ryan Holiday

- Have a bias toward action — let’s see something happen now. You can break that big plan into small steps and take the first step right away. — Indira Gandhi

> The superior man acts before he speaks and afterward speaks according to his action. - Confucius

- When we don’t act we create burdens for ourselves. Unaccomplished goals and ideas are like having too many programs running on your computer. It slows you down.
- Once you get rolling, momentum will keep you moving. Action creates more action. Momentum will help you to move ahead more quickly.
- Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. And when preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something.

## Ikigai 
The convergence of four primary elements:
-   What you love (your passion)
-   What the world needs (your mission)
-   What you are good at (your vocation)
-   What you can get paid for (your profession)

- "The best Founders we see at NFX know when to rethink the assumptions that they and everybody else have made about an area, technology, or market. This unlocks breakthrough thinking in order to make the seemingly impossible, possible." via [Anti-Patterns of 10x Thinking](https://www.nfx.com/post/anti-patterns-of-10x-thinking/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=109515401&utm_content=109515401&utm_source=hs_email)

## Questions
- What are potential systems to increase the spread of information? Better than the internet? 
- How can we share information more efficiently? How can we increase the quality of information? What are all the forms of information? Has this evolved over time? Or have we just created the technological capacity to quantify this information?

# February 4, 2021
- What is going to act as the base infrastructure and protocols for the metaverse?
	- we are already fragmenting the metaverse in web3.0. 
	- is it going to start with gaming platforms? or can we take the employment route? 
	- what about the cryptocurrencies of each platform. Is there going to be a single accepted currency? A tool or protocol that will easily process the transaction of different currencies...
	- build an operating system? decentralized? 

> “Doubt what you know, be curious about what you don’t, and update your views based on new data.”

# January 25, 2021

- Are you a producer or a consumer?
- Are you a consumer or an owner? 

> "We're drowning in information and starving for wisdom."

> "Life supports what supports more of life." - Tony Robbins 

# January 24, 2021

## Offense vs. Defense 
- The phases one experiences can be perceived as offense and defense. 
- Defense being primarily reading, researching, and preparation. Time pondering and plotting your next moves. 
- Looking at trends, market forces, emerging technologies and ideologies. 
- Based on the information you begin to formulate your plans and projects. 
- To bring these projects to fruition and wide-scale adoption you must enter the offense phase. 
- Offense can be described as building; this often takes the form of recruiting, team building, launching products, raising capital for your ventures, marketing/advertising and focusing on users.

>  “Lasting peace and harmony inherently requires differentiation. A stable society is a differentiated one.”
- **Be aware of the self-serving bias: We tend to attribute good things to our own skill, and we tend to attribute bad things that happen to us to luck**


# January 3, 2021

- Any product that has a social component baked in has fundamental advantages over competing non-social products: better growth loops, better engagement, better retention, better defensibility. 
- These advantages accumulate over time.

## Thoughts on Time + Energy Investment
- Most spend high amounts of time on things where input is low energy. 
- 80/20 - 80% of tasks we invest 20% of our energy (low energy); 20% of tasks take 80% of our energy 
- The goal is to align high amounts of time investment with high levels of energy. You will accomplish significantly more. 

# December 31, 2020

> There’s an old saying that the first fifty years of the car industry were about creating car companies and working out what cars should look like, and the second fifty years were about what happened once everyone had a car - they were about McDonalds and Walmart, suburbs and the remaking of the world around the car, for good and of course bad. The innovation in cars became everything around the car. One could suggest the same today about smartphones - now the innovation comes from everything else that happens around them.

- FDA approves genetically engineered pigs
	- The pigs, developed by medical company Revivicor, could be used in the production of drugs, to provide organs and tissues for transplants, and to produce meat that’s safe to eat for people with meat allergies.
	- The pigs are called GalSafe pigs 
	- they lack a molecule called alpha-gal sugar, which can trigger allergic reactions

## Notes on blockchain
- As tokenised virtual assets increase in value, they can be traded, insured, and securitised. In the right circumstances, users might also be able to obtain loans from their NFTs and to lease their NFTs if they don’t use them often. And if NFTs and other virtual assets are in high demand, users would want to buy and sell them on trusted platforms for other virtual assets, cryptocurrencies, or real money. 
- By the same logic, the NFT market has the potential to skyrocket if a small number of blockchain-based apps can reach mainstream status and have a potential knock-on effect for other NFT assets. 
- By creating an open developer platform, in combination with a free market-based economic system and a high number of users, Decentraland can provide substantial incomes to investors and potentially entrepreneurs within the platform, first through real estate transactions, and subsequently through virtual goods. 
	
- [opensea](https://opensea.io/) = a marketplace for virtual goods, they do millions in transaction volume

[Notes via Barack Obama Medium article](https://barackobama.medium.com/how-i-approach-the-toughest-decisions-dc1b165cdf2d)
- the world rarely consists of black and white, devleop mental models to think about the world and make decisons. 
- develop a process for making decision
	- listen to close advisors and your team
	- ask for the feedback of people smarter and more knowledgable than you are
	- build your dark net. Reid Hoffman reference 
	- develop a group of advisors who think differently 
	- it is not diversity when everyone looks different but thinks the same. 
	- have at least one contrarian 
- take time to recharge and decompress 

Notes & Quotes via [Why the Future Doesn't Need Us](https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/)
- And even if we scatter to the stars, isn't it likely that we may take our problems with us or find, later, that they have followed us? The fate of our species on Earth and our fate in the galaxy seem inextricably linked.
- Aristotle opened his Metaphysics with the simple statement: "All men by nature desire to know."
- If open access to and unlimited development of knowledge henceforth puts us all in clear danger of extinction, then common sense demands that we reexamine even these basic, long-held beliefs.
- It is this further danger that we now fully face—the consequences of our truth-seeking. The truth that science seeks can certainly be considered a dangerous substitute for God if it is likely to lead to our extinction.
- Thoreau also said that we will be "rich in proportion to the number of things which we can afford to let alone." We each seek to be happy, but it would seem worthwhile to question whether we need to take such a high risk of total destruction to gain yet more knowledge and yet more things; common sense says that there is a limit to our material needs—and that certain knowledge is too dangerous and is best forgone.

- What is terraforming = process of modifying the atmosphere, temperature, ecology, etc of a planet or moon to be similar to the earth, to make it inhabitable 

## Knowledge
- think about knowledge and memory as a semantic tree or the internet
	- you have a web of knowledge, links, an intranet. 
	- continue to link pages together and you will better be able to recall information 


# December 10, 2020

## Notes & Quotes 
- via [Why the Future Doesn't Need Us](https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/)
- First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better than human beings can do them. In that case presumably all work will be done by vast, highly organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary. 
- As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones.
- Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control. People won't be able to just turn the machines off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide.
- Moravec's view is that the robots will eventually succeed us—that humans clearly face extinction.
- [Roddenberry's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry) vision of the centuries to come was one with strong moral values, embodied in codes like the [Prime Directive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kMiL1LBDvo): to not interfere in the development of less technologically advanced civilizations.
- In The Agony and the Ecstasy, Irving Stone's biographical novel of Michelangelo, Stone described vividly how Michelangelo released the statues from the stone, "breaking the marble spell," carving from the images in his mind. 4 In my most ecstatic moments, the software in the computer emerged in the same way. Once I had imagined it in my mind I felt that it was already there in the machine, waiting to be released. Staying up all night seemed a small price to pay to free it—to give the ideas concrete form.
- Failing to understand the consequences of our inventions while we are in the rapture of discovery and innovation seems to be a common fault of scientists and technologists.
- The dream of robotics is, first, that intelligent machines can do our work for us, allowing us lives of leisure, restoring us to Eden.
- In his history of such ideas, [Darwin Among the Machines](https://www.amazon.com/Darwin-among-Machines-Evolution-Intelligence/dp/0465031625), George Dyson warns: "In the game of life and evolution there are three players at the table: human beings, nature, and machines. I am firmly on the side of nature. But nature, I suspect, is on the side of the machines." As we have seen, Moravec agrees, believing we may well not survive the encounter with the superior robot species.

- One of management guru Peter Drucker’s most famous lines is “what gets measured gets managed.” 
- [[Ice Therapy]]: Scientific research has found that the body burns more energy when subjected to cold temperatures.


# December 8, 2020
## The Smartest Generation
- We have the ability to be more intelligent than any other generation of humans that has come before us. 
	- simply because of the access to general knowledge and specialized knowledge at scale we have at our fingertips.
	- we can access the ideas, theories, and thoughts of the best minds living today at the click of a button.
	- we can access college courses, podcasts, youtube, all of this was not available even just a few years ago. 
	- Perhaps, if Dan Carlin was right and we are not smart enough to solve the problems we have created for ourselves...
	- we can become smarter in the coming decades to design solutions to our most complex problems. 

## Topics to research 
- cryptography 
- cypherpunk
- smart contracts 
- blockchain

# December 7, 2020
- [Via Ben Greenfield blog](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/article/brain-articles/what-is-qualia/)
- Daniel Schmachtenberger describes how many “smart drugs” work by artificially increasing one chemical in the brain by overriding its natural function. Problem is, this can cause depletion or neglect of other things, causing imbalances and negative consequences like dependency or a post-smart drug “crash.” 
- Recent research suggests that the notion of a single intelligence quotient vastly oversimplifies intelligence, which is in fact composed of various aspects of what is called “multiple intelligences,” such as verbal intelligence, problem-solving, spatial reasoning, etc.
- This is all based on a theory proposed by Howard Gardner which states that intelligence is not unified, but rather multiple, consisting of a set of relatively independent intelligences including linguistic intelligence, mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, musical intelligence, kinesthetic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, naturalist intelligence, and even based on more recent research, the addition of spiritual intelligence and emotional intelligence.

## On Hiring 
- "So the way to compete against the giants is not with money. Google will outbid you. They have oil derrick that spits out $30bn in search revenue every year. To win, you need to tell a story about cogs. At Google, you’re a cog. Whereas with me, you’re an instrumental piece of this great thing that we’ll build together. Articulate the vision. Don’t even try to pay well. Meet people’s cash flow needs. Pay them so they can cover their rent and go out every once in awhile. It’s not about cash. It’s about breaking through the wall of cynicism. It’s about making 1% of this new thing way more exciting than a couple hundred grand and a cubicle at Google."

# December 4, 2020
- A government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to distribute money to us when it’s needed most.
> If the work you’re doing isn’t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we’ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems — we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.

# November 30, 2020

- In the beginning, great technologies are complicated and attractive to a small group of people, typically the 'rebels' of society - or people interested in freedom of speech or freedom in general 
	- think personal computers or the internet 
	- what is this now? blockchain, crypto, ideas of decentralization 
	- this started in the 1990s

## Currency is always being recycled 
- think corporations, they invest and spend money, consumers take the money and spend it and it goes right back to the same corporations 
- via investments, employees, etc. 


# November 28, 2020
- I think it is important to be paranoid - the lack of paranoia and foresight to consider 2nd and 3rd order consequences is what has led to the current climate in politics and economics. 
- I am concerned about a small number of corporations owning all of the algorithms that will result in an even larger accumulation of capital by a small number of people, and the algorithms will have inherent biases and will control even more of our lives than today. 

- A possible answer is to create a more distributed world, help more people accumulate capital, I do like the idea of everyone working for the common good but this is not inherent to human nature - this is why capitalism has worked to increase standard of living via technoloy and innovation. 

# November 26, 2020
## Consciousness
- This thing we call [[consciousness]] seems to me to be so fragile. In that, we can sit quietly and clear our minds for 30 minutes via meditation or ingest small amounts of a substance and our identity, worldview, and perceptions can be drastically altered. 
- So much so, we expand our identity to become almost a different person - in the way we speak and observe the events around us for a period of time. 
- Making the hypothesis,  most notably to my knowledge, by [[Buckmister Fuller]] - that at some point in the future we'll be able to transfer ourselves/consiousness to far away places. This seems on-base to me if consciouness is this fragile. Just a bunch of atoms. 

- An observation I have been pondering recently is how signigicant an impact the ideas, and theories one has at my current stage 18-25, reflects and predicts the time and energy investment of that person in the following years of their life. 
- On the contrary, it is unfortunate many people do not continue to follow these things. (this is due to a number of reasons)
- But, I think back to [Elon's list](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-on-startalk-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-2015-4) of the 5 biggest areas he thinks will have the most impact on the future of humanity and he has been dedicating his life to these ideas every since. 
	- he first postulated on these ideas when he was around 20, in college. 

- Personally, I am very interested in the future of work/education, biotechnology, blockchain/decentralization, metaverse/virtual worlds, gameb, startups, and technology - it is likely the following decades of my life will consist of these things - via working in startups/solving problems that correlate to these ideas.

- Technology and startups feel like they're moving so fast, but any important companies or products take 10+ years to build. 
	- all big things start small, all good things take time. 
	- everything important takes long term thinking 

- I like to frame ideas in questions sometimes
- I like to look for solutions/ideas by asking questions
- Question perceived truths and paradigms
	- if biz owners could use 1 algorithm to run their entire business, would they? 
	- Is the current workplace/employment model going to last 5 more years? What does the new model look like? Why will it or won't it last? (what emerging technologies and trends would shape a shift?)
	- What is the best way to solve these questions? Technological innovation 
	- What does the workforce of tomorrow look like?

### Nixon ended the gold standard in 1971 - our dollar is not backed by anything.
- These monetary dislocations have impacted several areas of our society. Consumer health relies on heavily inflated asset prices, not the health of the real economy. With price stability dissipating, rampant inflation has lifted consumer prices, lowering our standard of living. As we lose 2% of our purchasing power leaving our money in the bank, we must throw our savings into an overvalued stock market fueled by speculation and greed — not a booming economy that we desperately need. Since we have to work 300% harder to buy the same stock, we’re always busy, tired, and broke. We take shortcuts, bolstering the disastrous American diet. Our lust for fast food has created a simultaneous mental health and obesity crisis.
- The rise of blockchain technology has revolutionized how we think about money in the 21st-century. It’s the first time in history where money can be transferred peer to peer without passing through a central authority, the first decentralized network to enable the financially savvy, from hardcore Cypherpunks to GenZ libertarians, to break free from the tyrannical forces of the modern financial system.

## Lessons

- Surround yourself with smarter, more mature minds. The smartest people you can find. 
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you and teach you. 
- Entrepreneurs must be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. 
- As a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. 

## Breakthrough in aging 
- Tel Aviv University found a form of oxygen therapy - hyperbaric oxygen chamber - can be used to reverse two key indicators of biologicla aging: telomere length and senescent cells 
- what are telomeres = telomeres are the protective caps on the end of chromosomes 
- what are senescent cells = cells that are older and worn out

> There’s people who change the world, and then there’s people who criticize them.
- Don't have an issue with valid criticism. 

# November 20, 2020 
- As with many things in life, we are restricted by knowledge and awareness.
- I ask, what are the bottlenecks that exist preventing the transition to accelerated growth and innovation? 
- Many exist, with Oz we are focusing on the employment and workplace model.

> Be in a hurry to learn, not in a hurry to get validation. — Evan Williams
- All we have in this life is time and energy, it is up to us to choose how we would like to invest each of these. 

# November 16, 2020
- Everybody has a worldview, a unique way of looking at the world. We see opportunities based on this worldview. Where you see nothing, someone else may see an amazing opportunity. 
- I like to think of it as a light specturm - you see a vertical slice of the spectrum - and you will live your life based on that perspective, where someone else sees a different world because they have a different slice. 
- To me, it's exciting to think about the entire spectrum - all of the opportunities, trends, ideas, etc that exist - and how you only see a fraction of them with your current perspective. 
- and realize that you can begin to explore, be curious, and expand that perspective to increase the number of opportunities you see. 
- The world is full of opportunities. 
- You can increase your perspective to optimize.

# November 11, 2020

## Thoughts
- we currently live in a Game A system - in this system you are objectively 'rewarded' for pursuing domination, wealth, control, power, market share (insert any Game A vector)
- Also, competition and rivalry are innate to human biology - there is no reason to feel guilty for pursuing wealth and success 
- *Let the spirtual guide the individual*
- So much fear and doubt - resulting in procrastination - exists in my life because I am a proponent of decentralization and power to the people so I want to work on projects which insert these ideas and types of ventures at a societal scale
- But, as I am learning, it is difficult in today's world to reach a critical mass of people with these ideas
- So, is the interim answer to pursue Game A projects in the near term - accumulate capital and power i.e. a vehicle (connections, reputation, capital) and then use this platform/vehicle to pursue projects I am passionate about?
	
## Work
- work is SO fascinating to me 
- we spend a third or more of our lives on something whether we like it or not, most people hate it, or tolerate it at best, and this is all in the name of what? 
- perpetuating a system that we are slaves to - to accomplish things we have been programmed to 'want to' accomplish 
- I think it unlocks the keys to the the future/universe - bc if we restructure the work model we unlock so much time 
- time to then invest into new ideas, technologies, the sciences, etc. 
- all stems back to one of my core axioms that the ultimate product of the human mind is to create and build - so what is preventing humanity from doing more of this? what do we spend our time doing? WORK
- we need to reform the work model - this will have political, economic, and social implications 
- also, many do not find work interesting

-  “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor, it’s a Sign of Weakness
- [How to Avoid the Busy Trap (and Other Misuses of Your Time)](https://tim.blog/2016/03/21/avoid-the-busy-trap/)
	> Being busy is a form of mental laziness. -Tim Ferriss
- For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.
- “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”


# November 9, 2020
- Trying to outcompete rivals leads to mediocre performance, so companies should avoid competition and seek to create value instead of beating rivals. 
- the Hindu [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) teach that the world spins along an endless cycle: creation, rise, decline, destruction, and rebirth. Even if the cycle repeats for millions of years, it will continue to spin forever. 
	- Nisbet argues that ancient people saw time as cyclical, and no idea has been more important to Western Civilization than the idea of progress. 
	- Christian theology sees time as linear. It moves away from the Garden of Eden, and toward a day of judgement, justice, and the establishment of a divine, peace-filled kingdom. 
- To Peter Thiel, short-term thinking is the essence of sin. Like The Bible, he advises us to make plans and sacrifice the present for the future. 
Greatness is like chess. Chess player José Raúl Capablanca said: “To begin you must study the end. You don’t want to be the first to act, you want to be the last man standing.” 

> “The shortest distance between two points is reliably a straight line. If your dreams are apparent to you, pursue them. Creating optionality and buying lottery tickets are not weigh stations on the road to pursuing your dreamy outcomes. They are dangerous diversions that will change you.”
> "When we pursue optionality, we avoid bold decisions. Like anything meaningful, venturing into the unknown is an act of faith. It demands responsibility. You‘ll have to take a stand, trust your decision, and ignore the taunts of outside dissent. But a life without conviction is a life controlled by the futile winds of fashion. Or worse, the hollow echoes of the crowd."

- all objects are desirable when they belong to your neighbor. Society will push you towards competition, but you shouldn’t compete with your peers or depend on them for guidance.

- Nobel Prize-winning physicist [Richard Feynman[[ (1918–1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)
	- expert for remembering what he learned
	- consumption does not equal learning - our brains filter and forget most of what we consume - or we wouldn't be able to operate in the world. 
	- A person who reads without pausing to think and reflect won’t remember nor apply anything they read.
	- Articulate what you read, write down key points, ask questions, explain it to someone.
	
> Truth is one, the wise call it by different names. 

- Assume you are wrong - always seek the truth, listen to the bad news. 
- It is very difficult to remain moral and ethical in a game theoretical world. 
	- even if you want to do the right thing, and choose not to do something, you will be beaten in Game A terms by someone who is willing to do the things you are not. 

# November 8, 2020

- come up with more ideas and theories
	- alternatives to current political, economic, and social structures
	- economic theory that doesn't capitalize every thing and idea
	- poitical stucture where groups are in charge (is this possible?)

## [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)
- Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
	- A New Zealand firm tested a 4-day workweek and found that it actually boosted productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction.
	- In 2019, Microsoft Japan closed their offices every Friday, and saw a ~39% increase in YoY sales per employee.
	- A 23-month study in Sweden found that nurses who worked a 6-hour workday had higher productivity levels and lower absentee rates than those with a longer workday

## [The Streisand Effect: try to remove something from the internet publicly, more people will view it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)

- “Williams James knew that every man is “ready to be savage in some cause.” The distinction, he said, between good people and bad people is “the choice of the cause.”” (89)
- “The essential trait of the successful man is not only perseverance but almost a perverse expectation of how difficult it is going to be. It is having redundancies on top of redundancies, so you can absorb the losses you eventually incur. One must not just steel one’s heart but also one’s spirit so that there is no such thing as an obstacle – just information. The earlier you spot and anticipate setbacks, the less demoralizing they will be. We want things to be easy. We want them to be clean. They rarely are.” (126)
- “And so it is that even setbacks can contain opportunities within them, if conspirators are patient and resourceful enough.” (129)
- “Machiavelli would say that a coup or a conspiracy can succeed only if the will of the people is on its side.” (241)
- “The world was not big enough for Alexander the Great, but a coffin was.” — Juvenal

> When you unprogram yourself, you see that there’s other forms of currency. Like relationships are a more important currency than money itself and that’s what we really sought.

## Frameworks for Entrepreneurs
- Instead of making a to-do list, ask what is the one highest impact thing I could do today?
- Prioritize the rest of your tasks based on impact and urgency
- What’s the most important thing you can be working on right now

- Set clear measurable goals that are both ambitious and realistic
	- Then set your anti-goals, the things you don’t want to happen along the way
	- Run quick calculations on what it will take to succeed, then spring into action

- Be impatient with action and patient with results

- Always take action when you make a decision, get 1 hour of momentum
	- For instance, talk to a customer or send a cold email 

- Become a person that just does the work
- amateurs focus on outcomes, professionals focus on the process and strategy
- motivation is the result of process, not the cause. 
- example; the most successful entrepreneurs are not focused on 'grinding' or 'hustling' they are just doing what they do - they are focused on the process

- as a CEO, the ultimate goal is to build a strategic machine that successfully accomplishes the outcomes and objectives of the organization 
	- recruiting 
	- building culture 
	- growth strategy 
	- operations 
	- customer, client, user conversations
	- accounting 
	- funding 
	- development 

## Fiscal Illusion
- Term coined by Amilcare Puviani in 1903
- fiscal illusion theorizes that the ruling class intentionally misleads the public by exaggerating the benefits of public services and obscuring the total tax burden.
- theory was developed and popularized by economist James Buchanan in the 1960s as a way to better understand tax policies and outcomes.
	
## For prioritizing projects 
1) Is this task still important, or has the situation changed? Often we commit to tasks or projects that are important at the time, but become less important as situations evolve.
2) Am I really the only person who can do this? Many top performers think that doing something on their own is easier than teaching someone else how to do it. Trust your colleagues, and give them the chance to surprise you.
3) Is this the most important thing right now? Or am I using it to avoid something else? Deep down, you know when you’re doing this.
4) If this was the only thing I completed today, would I be satisfied with my day’s work? Part of avoiding burnout is focusing on work that will give us a sense of accomplishment.

## Elon Musk
  - goal is to extend human consciousness as far as possible into the future so we can understand more about consciousness
  - to do so, we cannot stay on earth
- question: why can we not stay on earth
  - there will be a self-terminating event or natural event that ends human life in future
  - Elon's answer is to become a multi-planetary species and build cities on [[Mars]]
  - Other potential solutions to this problem include taking a look at physics
  
## Biocentrism
  - Concepts such as time, space, and even causality are increasingly being demonstrated as meaningless.
  - All of science is based on information passing through our consciousness but science hasn’t the foggiest idea what consciousness is, and it can’t explain the linkage between subatomic states and observation by conscious observers. 
  - Science describes life as a random occurrence in a dead universe but has no real understanding of how life began or why the universe appears to be exquisitely designed for the emergence of life.

## [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/)
  - Maximum polarization on both political sides
	  - ea. side believes if the other wins it will be the end of the republic of America
	  - we believe what feels true and what those around us choose to believe 
  - Since earliest large scale civilizations (Egypt and Sumeria) a very small percentage of these groups have been republics
	  - most are monarchies/top down systems 
	  - corporations are run this way as well, hierarchies 
  - democracies and republics typically follow a period of [[cultural enlightenment]]
	  - the people in the society are all educated and understand how the society works
	  - this creates the ability to collectively sensemake.

 ## Autonomous Driving 
 - industry will likely submit to natural geographic monoplies due to the amount of location-specific driving data necessary to launch and have a winning platform. 
 - first movers will be able to collect more data thus increasing the likliehood of having a better platform. 
 
  
## Estonia
  - Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation with a population of only ~1.3 million people, is considered one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.
  - The world’s first e-government 🇪🇪
  - The first country to launch a Digital Nomad Visa
  - The first country to offer digital residency to non-Estonians living anywhere in world
  - The first country to hold nationwide elections using electronic voting 
  - The first country that Ikea first entered digitally before establishing a physical presence
  
## Genies
-  Created an agency named [[Avatar Agency]] to represent the interests of celebrity digital doubles
  - Avatars don’t get tired, can “travel” anywhere, and are available 24 hours a day.
  - idea: As the next generation of consumers spend increasingly more of their lives in some form of a digital realm, 3D avatars will likely be everywhere.
  - idea: Avatars are the next medium of expression, and 3D allows you to effectively operate and command virtual beings.

question: How big is the digital goods opportunity?
idea: I’m very bullish on digital goods. Take Fortnite: Last year, it sold $1B in avatar skins.

# October 21, 2020

- Very important to recognize the motives driving the actions of individuals and society
- Be willing to take a different path
  - reverse engineer your desires and motives to get at the root of what interests you and what you believe is important for the future of humanity. 
  - typically, we have a dozen or more motives driving our actions, we are personally only aware of half of them, and we only publicly share 2-3 of them. 
- Accept that the path for you will likely be dissimilar to the path pursued by the masses
- The path being followed by the masses is not always the right path, find the right path for you. 
- Success is at the intersection of your strenghts, a topic that excites you, and self belief. 
- Compare yourself to where you were yesterday, not to where someone else is today. 

- Question: do you build a personal brand, corporate brand, or neither? 
  - I do not intend to build a personal brand at the moment. 
  - However, I do believe it to be critical for certain discussions in society to take place.
  - If I see a lack of dialouge around a positive future, transparency, decentralization, etc. it may make sense to build a brand to share messages that I thinnk urgently need to be spread.

## Creativity
Take ideas from one place and applying them to another. Even if it's totally different context. Study things that may seem totally unrelated to what you're currently doing. 

It's easier to be a critic than a creator. 

Creativity isn't about creating something totally new. It's about refashioning something that already exists. So - to be more creative read a lot of things in different contexts 

What valuable market is no one going after?

# April 15, 2019

### We're simply the by-product of millions of years of evolution and adaption. A few millennia ago, we didn't have the level of self-awareness and consciousness that we have today. The same stresses about life, work, finances, health, relationships. Life, as we know it today, has grown so complex. We're worried about our careers, how we're gonna make money, if you're gonna go out to lunch today, that guy that just cut you off on the highway, checking Snapchat or Instagram - these things didn't exist. We're so overwhelmed. We're just conditioned and used to it. It's business as usual. What if we returned to the simplicity. The planet functions on cycles, as do societies. What will it take, to get that simplicity back? 

# April 12, 2019

- It's always going to feel like there is more to do. 
> Your dream dies tomorrow. 
- The planet has existed for 13.8 billion years. We have the opportunity to change what life has been like forever. The greatest change since the beginning of mankind. Creating something that has not existed in billions of years. 
- Focus on something bigger. Focus on changing the universe forever. All of humanity as we know it. 
Make a better Google. Everything is searchable. Education content. Email. Articles. Everything on one platform. Social media. 


# April 5, 2019

## Scaling Ideas
- Everything around us was once an idea in someone's head, but they're not the one who carries it out once the idea gets going.
- An idea, once implemented, takes on a life of its own. 
- This is why it is so important to share your ideas with the world. Because of what happens once they are out in the world.

# March 9, 2019

- Always work hard on something that is uncomfortably exciting. 


# March 1, 2019

> If you feel lost, remember it gets better with time. 
- We often are compelled to help those in a phase of their life that we personally went through and grew the most. 
- Understand this, and learn what motivates individuals and what their ultimate purpose is - where they receive fulfillment.

## The Digital Society Accelerator
- Help people launch businesses and document the process

## Thought
- Lots of funding and talent flowing to e-learning/courses
- Is there a possibility big companies (Netflix, Amazon) are making people lazier, to the point where they are not so interested in learning?
- There still exists a necessity to learn, acquire skills, etc to apply to careers. 

# February 20, 2019

## Idea
- "Content autopilot" - a software that creates your email list or social media content and send it out to your subscribers and followers automatically. 
- People do not pay you because you have likes and followers, they pay because you serve them and provide value. 
- What if social media didn't exist? 

# February 19, 2019

- The mind is capable of absolutely anything. We can all be chosen ones, It is all in your mind. 
- It is a process of rewiring your mind. You can rewire your mind to optimize for whatever you want. 
- Material items are the byproduct of focus, work ethic, and mission. 

# February 4, 2019

- One of the hardest parts of running a business in knowing what to do and what to focus on -- having clarity. Starting a new business or new endeavor can be overwhelming. 
- Lack of knowledge or resources typically isn't the problem - it's just not knowing where to start. There's no shortage of information. 

# January 13, 2019

> It would be a sin to not share what is inside of your head with the world. The creativty you share will make the world a more productive and happier place. Don't rob the world of your gifts.

# January 9, 2019

- If you are driven by materialistic items and buying things i.e. working for a new watch or new car (selfish goals that benefit you and you alone) you will never be truly fulfilled, no matter how many things you accumulate. 
- Successful people are driven by fulfilling a mission and helping/serving. Something much bigger than themselves. Selfless goals that benefit humanity. (They may reward themselves with material items, but that is not their primary motivator, rather a by-product). 

> Happiness comes from setting life goals for yourself and progressing and improving as a person as you work towards them and being able to celebrate those achievements with those closest to you. 

# January 6, 2019

# Questions
- How/why do you keep going? 
(I’ve realized it’s not about the money, that’s what you hear all the time but when you’re broke that’s typically your primary motivator and focus. Once you have it, it’s not the goal anymore.) 
- Money does not make you happy, but not having money can make you unhappy.
- When were you happiest in life? Now or younger with less responsibilities? 
- If you could not pass any money to your kids, what 3 strategies or tips would you give them? 

- Book on money [Thou Shall Prosper: Ten Commandments for Making Money](https://www.amazon.com/Thou-Shall-Prosper-Commandments-Making/dp/0470485884).

> I wasn't interested in making a lot of money but I was interested in making a lot of living. - Dale Carnegie

- Everyday is a new life to a wise man.
- Don't expect anything from anyone.
- Focus on actionable goals. What can you do today? 
- Be contrarian. Do what others aren't doing. 

- There should be fires - be worried if things are going perfect. 
- God gives the toughest battles to the strongest of his people.

# September 18, 2018

- People don't value what they don't fight for.
1. Love is everything 
2. The secret to living is giving (to give you have to keep growing)
3.  When your suffering you're obsessing about yourself, how you have less or lost love or a material thing. All suffering is about self, so shift your view and start appreciating things outside yourself. 
> Some people are praying for the things you take for granted. 

- Manage expectations 
- Do things right - and if you make a mistake learn from it. Experience comes from bad decisions. 
- Find a need and focus on it - solve peoples problems. 
- Travel often

# September 15, 2018

- Follow what excites you. 
- Everyone works when they're motivated, it takes a true champion to work when they're not motivated. 
- "Those who most need to do something are the least likely to do it. Those who are overweight are the least likely to exercise and eat healthily. Those who are poor are the least likely to learn about their finances and growing income."
	- is this paradigm accurate? 
	- if it is true, why? 
- Progress = Happiness 
- Life is about growth and giving. 

# September 11, 2018

- Core components of making a dream come true: having a clear vision, making actionable goals, leveraging and building networks, and getting out of your comfort zone to make that dream come true. 
- Take MASSIVE action.
- Risks aren't that scary once you take them. 
> "I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened."- Mark Twain
- We as humans fear the unknown and the "not yet." Live simply and be happy in the moment.
- What we most fear doing is what we most need to do. Your success in life is determined by the number of uncomfortable situations your willing to put yourself into. Do one thing every day that you fear. 
- 99% of people in the world are convinced that they are incapable of achieving great things so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for realistic goals. It is easier to raise $1M than $100K, it is easier to pick up the one 10 in a bar than the five 8s. If you're insecure, the rest of the world is too.

# September 4, 2018

- While the ambition of changing the world and inspiring creators and everyday people to follow their dreams is an important driving force - I just love a challenge. Life is one big challenge to me. I’m in a competition with myself every single day. I do it to prove to myself that I can. I have these businesses and this vision for each of them and what I want to be able to accomplish with them and the people we want to impact, but at the end of the day just love the process.
- My life is dedicated to teaching people how to create freedom and happiness and stability in their lives. Escape the status quo.


# September 1, 2018

## Thoughts 

- Few will act for the many, but many will act for the one. (Find one person or your family that you’re doing it for) 

# March 25, 2018

- Your self worth doesn't come from what you earn, it comes from what you create. Create something - don't just own something. 
- Always be who you are. Never give up your identity to fit into society. 
- Stay crazy - it's the crazy ones who change the world. 
- Intellectual curiosity - never stop learning. 
- Find happiness inside you. Be at peace with yourself. 
- Learn to navigate the gray. Life is full of black and white, new and different situations. It's ok to not know the answers, make the decision you think is best and feels right to you. This means you are growing.
- Stay close to anything that makes you glad you are alive. 

# March 22, 2018
