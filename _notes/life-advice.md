- If someone is trying to convince you it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme.
- Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.
- Being wise means having more questions than answers.
- Achievements can fool you. How you live your life and treat your craft is all that matters.
- Most overnight successes — in fact any significant successes — take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly.
- If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.
- Show me your calendar and I will tell you your priorities. Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you where you’re going.
- Always say less than necessary.
- Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.
- Bad things can happen fast, but almost all good things happen slowly.
- You can’t know how things will turn out. You can only know whether or not you’re game for the adventure.
- All the greatest gains in life — in wealth, relationships, or knowledge —come from the magic of compounding interest — amplifying small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more than you subtract on a regular basis.
- To combat an adversary, become their friend.
- A single destructive habit, repeated day after day, can impact your entire life.
- Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.
- Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
- People who speak in complicated terms don’t typically know what they’re talking about. It’s the people who can explain complicated ideas or perspectives in extremely simple, immediately-understandable terms who are speaking from experience.
- The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
- You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.
- When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.
- Ideas are never perfect at first. They mature through development and collaboration. Don’t hesitate to share them with others. No one wants to steal your ideas. If you don’t believe me, try giving your ideas to people. Everyone already has enough to do.
- Often the people with the least to say take the longest to say it.
- The only worthwhile reason for criticizing people is to help them improve. If your feedback doesn’t meet that standard, it’s better to just keep your mouth shut.
- The level of coordination and organization to support most conspiracy theories is well beyond our companies and governments. A far more likely explanation for events is plain old incompetence.
