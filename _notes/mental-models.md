title: Mental Models
---

## Introduction 

In life and in business, it is absolutely critical to develop mental models and frameworks to successfully achieve objectives. 

- Mental models are how we understand the world around us; they shape how we think and understand things. 
- A mental model is a representation of how something works in our head, they help shape the connections and opportunities we see. This document will outline a few mental models to apply with primarily business use cases. 
- It is important to understand human nature, culture, and desires in business and in life. 
- Beginning to understand how societies function, operate, and why humans do the things they do is very critical if you hope to have any success in life. 
- In startups, we must build products and services which seamlessly integrate with human nature, not against it. 

### Side note: Life is situational - more important than learning the mental models, it is critical to learn which mental models and principles to exercise in a given context. Life is rarely black and white, it’s important to learn how to navigate the gray area. Knowledge of the proper applied use cases of mental models is acquired with 1) experience 2) mentors.

Parkinson’s Law: states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. 

Applied: we have shifted to a society of ‘earning a living,’ 5-day and 40-hour work weeks. This is against human nature. Shaped dramatically by the industrial revolution in the 19th century. 

Hofstadter's Law: is a statement of the difficulty of accurately estimating the amount of time it will take to complete tasks of any substantial complexity.

Applied: things almost always take longer than we expect. We can do most of the things we want to do, they’re just going to take longer than we think they will, And during this timeframe, due to lack of results, many people give up. 

Sayre’s Law: In any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake. 

Maximize Potential: We want to maximize our potential in all aspects of our lives. How wealthy can you become? How impactful can you become? How generous can we be? How happy can we be? How many adventures can we experience? 
- The base question of some of these is why do we want to see our potential in wealth for example? After all, wealth and currency is a socially constructed illusion and currency is simply a vehicle and a tool. But, I would also say that the more wealth you accumulate the more impact you can have on the world and those around you. Edit: certainly not the only way to have a big impact.
