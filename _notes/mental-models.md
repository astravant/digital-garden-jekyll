## Introduction 

In life and in business, it is absolutely critical to develop mental models and frameworks to successfully achieve objectives. 

- Mental models are how we understand the world around us; they shape how we think and understand things. 
- A mental model is a representation of how something works in our head, they help shape the connections and opportunities we see. This document will outline a few mental models to apply with primarily business use cases. 
- Learning to understand how societies function, operate, and why humans do the things they do is very critical if you hope to have any success in life. 
- In startups, we must build products and services which seamlessly integrate with human nature, not against it. 

Quick note: Life is situational - more important than learning the mental models, it is critical to learn which mental models and principles to exercise in a given context. Life is rarely black and white, it’s important to learn how to navigate the gray area. Knowledge of the proper applied use cases of mental models is acquired with 1) experience 2) mentors.

> The quality of our thinking is proportional to the models in our head and their usefulness in the situation at hand.

### Parkinson’s Law
- Work expands to fill the time available for its completion. 

Applied: we have shifted to a society of ‘earning a living,’ 5-day and 40-hour work weeks. This is against human nature. This was shaped dramatically by the industrial revolution in the 19th century. 

### Hofstadter's Law
- A statement of the difficulty of accurately estimating the amount of time it will take to complete tasks of any substantial complexity.

Applied: things almost always take longer than we expect. We can do most of the things we want to do, they’re just going to take longer than we think they will. During this timeframe, due to lack of results, many people give up. 

### Sayre’s Law
- In any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake. 

### Circle of Competence
- When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, we have blind spots. If you know what you understand, you know where you have an edge over others. When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve. Understanding your circle of competence improves decision making and outcomes.

### Second-Order Thinking
- Almost everyone can anticipate the immediate results of their actions. Second-order thinking is thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically. It requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well.

### Occam's Razor
- Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones.
