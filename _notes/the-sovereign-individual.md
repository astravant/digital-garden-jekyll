Title: The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg

In the future, wealth will be measured not just by the amount in your bank account, but in your ability to structure your affairs to realize complete individual autonomy and independence.

The cybereconomy, more than any individual country’s economy, will be the greatest economic phenomenon of the future.

As our financial freedom increases, governments won’t have any choice but to treat us more like customers.

When money can be earned anywhere, you won’t be obligated to live in or subject yourself to high taxation. Governments that charge too much will drive away their best customers. The nation-state will not endure these changes in its present form.

> In the information age, a job will be a task that you do, not a thing that you have.

With technology increasing, we’ll move closer and closer to Neal Stephenson’s [[Metaverse]] in Snow Crash, where we live as much online as offline and conduct ourselves according to the online laws and customs, working in the cybereconomy.

Corruption, moral decline, and inefficiency appear to be signal features of the final stages of a system.

The information age will require new mechanisms of representation and government to avoid chronic dysfunction and even social collapse. The past systems will break down as technology advances.

Major transitions always involve a cultural revolution, and usually entail clashes between adherents of the old and new values.

The technology of the information age will make it easier to create assets outside the reach of typical forms of coercion, government or otherwise.
