We must design new systems that increase the flow and output of information. The more connected we become, the faster ideas spread, and the more sophisticated our tools for manipulating information become.

Look at how things flow, ask how they can flow better.

The governance structures, bureaucracies, and business models that serve us today are not going to cope with the issues in a world increasingly run by artificial intelligence (AI). As state systems fail to provide the services their populations need, we will see the spread of cloud communities: parallel networks of resources and services for local communities relying on each other instead of the government. These cloud communities will be transnational AND local: global information and resource sharing between pockets of locally high trust.

The purpose of a protocol is to increase the speed and efficiency at which humans can progress.

The web allows people to transcend any bad luck of being born in a certain country or state, they’re global citizens now. It is critical for us to deploy new information architecture for a globally distributed economy, and to rethink how we can build 21st-century systems that work better for more people over the long-term.

A successful system of the world devoted to rendering the full complexity of human life and mind. A system oriented to the creative dimensions of reality. For the first time in our evolutionary timeline, we have the consciousness and technologies to leverage the collective intelligence of humans and machines to transcend the boundaries of human constructs. Including political, economic, and social structures. A new trust foundation for the planet.

A better way to manage human ideas/information. A more efficient way for ideas to spread and evolve. This is for the spreading of ideas. If the universe is information and data, the system that better helps information spread wins

The prime objective with *** is to create a digital nation that can enable coordination on a large enough scale so we can begin to work collectively towards common goals. 

There is no certainty, only opportunity.

We stand at the dawn of a new age. One that demands new institutions.

New technologies offer portals to transcend the boundaries of current human constructs.

Today, bold visions are ignored and dismissed as lunacy. Optimism is withering. Big dreams are now seen as childish illusions. We no longer trust amateurs with vast imaginations, and we no longer challenge people to imagine futures that look radically different from the present. Instead, we defer only to experts with mainstream opinions.
The good news is there are ways of dealing with this problem, but solutions do not happen magically―they need work. Whether the future is better or worse will depend on our actions. It is up to us whether humanity may progress and continue to evolve- are we heading to Utopia or Oblivion? 

You have the power to change the world – one person and one project at a time. 

Be Visionary
