title: We Don't Own Ideas
---
 
The current paradigms in society are those which preach intellectual property, private property, patents, NDAs, etc. We are told to protect our ideas and control them as they are manifested through businesses, content, art, music, etc. We have come to believe we own our ideas.

Society’s current paradigm tells us that people have thoughts (we’re not quite sure where they come from but they are ours and ours alone). In ancient times, however, they believed thoughts had people and humans are simply vehicles to bring these ideas to life in the physical and material realm. We are very guarded when it comes to our thoughts, and we want to take credit for originating them. But, are we really the ones responsible?

See, a very detrimental problem arises when you believe you own your ideas and you prescribe to society’s current belief system of ownership. You will move significantly slower in bringing your ideas to life (and thus, prolong the time until you are successful). When you are so focused on controlling every piece of the puzzle so you can capitalize on and profit off of these ideas, you move much slower. We are focused on extracting from the world for personal gain. We need to focus on helping the world and creating value.

Now, I am not suggesting we not be rewarded for bringing ideas to fruition through hard work and perseverance. I am simply offering an alternative perspective to seeing the art of creation. The more willing you are to share your ideas with the world, the quicker you can assemble a team, the quicker you can be adding value to the marketplace, and the sooner you will be successful and benefiting humanity with your projects.

The point of this post is a simple paradigm shift – I am asking you to question the way things are and shift your perception on the idea of ownership and control.

If we see ideas, information, and data as things that belong to the universe; and we see it as our duty to bring them to life, we would be living in a much different world.

Instead, we are selfish – We want to own everything, and this slows us down significantly. It is our duty and obligation to share our ideas with the world because of what happens once they are out in the world.
