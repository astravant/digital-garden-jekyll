Title: GameB
---

## Introduction 

Game B is an approach to thinking up a sustainable, win-win alternative style of civilization instead of the unsustainable, win-lose model we have now.

GameB is conceived of “What Comes Next”, the social operating system that replaces GameA - the *Western Civilization* status quo.

- GameB should aim to maximize human potential and flourishing — what Maslow called “self-actualization”, with more attention than in [[GameA]] to high quality life.
- GameB should also engender a sense of real security from physical want and should make it much easier and natural to find friendship, fellowship, and love.

## What is it?
GameB is not yet well defined but it has four fundamentals:
- self-organizational
- network-oriented
- decentralized
- metastable for an extended period of time
