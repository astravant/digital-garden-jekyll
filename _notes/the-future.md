title: The Future
---

The future is going to be different than the present, but it will be rooted in the present. I look at the future as a set of potential outcomes, each with a different probability of becoming true based on our actions as a society and individually. Below are the industries, trends, and topics I am most excited about in the coming decades.

## Longevity 

> We spend billions of dollars a year researching diseases of aging like cancer and heart disease, but only a tiny fraction of that researching aging itself.

[Lifespan: Why We Age―and Why We Don't Have To](https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Why-Age_and-Dont-Have/dp/1501191977)

> It s a seemingly undeniable truth that aging is inevitable. But what if everything we've been taught to believe about aging is wrong? What if we could choose our lifespan?

## Education

> A small increase in the learning output of education systems across the globe would have an enormous impact on human productivity and economic growth.

> Human brain power is vastly underutilized on this planet because most people lack access to a good education. Strong education systems lead to greater social mobility, better workers, better citizens, and more and better startups.

## Future of Work

> Jobs will look very different 25 years from now.

[We're Never Going Back - The future of work is remote, and companies don't really have a choice.](https://www.notboring.co/p/were-never-going-back) by Packy McCormick

> Choosing to Return to the way things were is like choosing not to adopt software a decade or two ago. It’s an option, but one that will doom a company to mediocrity. 

[The Slow Death of the Firm](https://thecontrol.co/the-slow-death-of-the-firm-1bd6cc81286b) by Nick Tomaino

> Most people think of Bitcoin as a digital asset, but it can be thought of as something more general than that: a decentralized organization.

> This new organizational structure has resulted in [more than $500B](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) worth of value creation (today the total market value of Bitcoin is now larger than the market capitalization of Goldman Sachs).

[The Nature of the Firm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x) by Ronald Coase

- Ronald Coase wrote about the firm’s ability to minimize transaction costs in 1937

[The Blockchain Man](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/10/10/the-blockchain-man/)

> Blockchains are the hard technology that will take the lifestyle business and free agent economy across the chasm, making it mainstream in the way The Organization Man was mainstream beginning in the 1950s and 60s.

> Instead of a paycheck, The Blockchain Man’s income will be a large number of micropayments from past projects. The tokens from different projects will appreciate or depreciate based on the success of the project (and perhaps pay dividends).

> The emergence of blockchains will force The Organization Man to reckon with his own agency. How he deals with that reckoning will be the primary determinant of his life outcomes.


## Blockchain/DeFi

[Own the Internet - A Bull Case for Ethereum](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet) by Packy McCormick

> It’s one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto. 

> Bitcoin is easy. It’s digital gold. It’s a Store of Value (SoV). It just kind of sits there. 

> Ethereum is so much more than a cryptocurrency. It’s a “world computer,” and the “value layer” of the internet. It lets people build apps and products with money baked into the code. 

[The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) by Packy McCormick

> DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

> DAOs sit a level above NFTs -- DAOs can own NFTs and create NFTs, plus do a whole lot of other non-NFT things -- and have more transformative potential than NFTs. 

[Blockchain Can Wrest the Internet From Corporations' Grasp](https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/)

> It's time to restore the open source, community-led ethos of the original internet—with crypto.

> From the mid 2000s to the present, trust in open protocols was replaced by trust in corporate management teams

> As companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook built software and services that surpassed the capabilities of open protocols, users migrated to these more sophisticated platforms.

## Metaverse

[The Value Chain of the Open Metaverse](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-value-chain-of-the-open-metaverse) by Packy McCormick

> If one central company gains control of this, they will become more powerful than any government and be a god on Earth. - Tim Sweeney, CEO, Epic Games

> “Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.” - Chris Dixon

[Power to the Person - The Creator Economy, NFTs, and the Rise of the Solo Corporation](https://www.notboring.co/p/power-to-the-person)

> The Creator Economy and NFTs are massive human potential unlocks. Even if certain assets are in a short-term bubble, we are on an inexorable march towards individuals mattering more than institutions. 

> We’re on the precipice of a creative explosion, fueled by putting power, and the ability to generate wealth, in the hands of the people.

## Startup Cities

I believe in a world increasingly run by artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, etc. the governance structures and bureaucracies that serve us today will begin to fail to provide the services their populations need, so we will see the spread of startup cities and cloud communities.
