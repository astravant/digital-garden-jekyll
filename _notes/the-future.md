title: The Future
---

The future is going to be different than the present, but it will be rooted in the present. I look at the future as a set of potential paths, each with a different probability of becoming reality based on our actions as a society and individually. Below are the industries, trends, and topics I am most excited about in the coming decades.

## Longevity 

[Lifespan: Why We Age―and Why We Don't Have To](https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Why-Age_and-Dont-Have/dp/1501191977)

> It s a seemingly undeniable truth that aging is inevitable. But what if everything we ve been taught to believe about aging is wrong? What if we could choose our lifespan?

## Future of Work

[We're Never Going Back - The future of work is remote, and companies don't really have a choice.](https://www.notboring.co/p/were-never-going-back) by Packy McCormick

> Choosing to Return to the way things were is like choosing not to adopt software a decade or two ago. It’s an option, but one that will doom a company to mediocrity. 

> COVID triggered a rush to remote work, and proponents quickly prophesied a remote-only future in which everyone lives and works from anywhere -- the Peak of Inflated Expectations. 

[The Slow Death of the Firm](https://thecontrol.co/the-slow-death-of-the-firm-1bd6cc81286b) by Nick Tomaino

> Most people think of Bitcoin as a digital asset, but it can be thought of as something more general than that: a decentralized organization.

> This new organizational structure has resulted in [more than $500B](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) worth of value creation (today the total market value of Bitcoin is now larger than the market capitalization of Goldman Sachs).

[The Nature of the Firm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x) by Ronald Coase

[The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) by Packy McCormick

> DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

> DAOs sit a level above NFTs -- DAOs can own NFTs and create NFTs, plus do a whole lot of other non-NFT things -- and have more transformative potential than NFTs. 

[Blockchain Can Wrest the Internet From Corporations' Grasp](https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/)

> It's time to restore the open source, community-led ethos of the original internet—with crypto.

> From the mid 2000s to the present, trust in open protocols was replaced by trust in corporate management teams

> As companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook built software and services that surpassed the capabilities of open protocols, users migrated to these more sophisticated platforms.
