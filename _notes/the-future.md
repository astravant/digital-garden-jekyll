title: The Future
---

The future is going to be different than the present, but it will be rooted in the present. I look at the future as a set of potential paths, each with a different probability of becoming reality based on our actions as a society and individually. Below are the industries, trends, and topics I am most excited about in the coming decades.

## Longevity 

[Lifespan: Why We Age―and Why We Don't Have To](https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Why-Age_and-Dont-Have/dp/1501191977)

> It s a seemingly undeniable truth that aging is inevitable. But what if everything we ve been taught to believe about aging is wrong? What if we could choose our lifespan?

## Education

[DREAMSCAPE: 21ST CENTURY EDUCATION](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/science-age-reversal-0)

> Dreamscape Learn, a Los Angeles-based company that merges the power of Hollywood storytelling and immersive VR technology to disrupt how we teach and learn.


## Future of Work

[We're Never Going Back - The future of work is remote, and companies don't really have a choice.](https://www.notboring.co/p/were-never-going-back) by Packy McCormick

> Choosing to Return to the way things were is like choosing not to adopt software a decade or two ago. It’s an option, but one that will doom a company to mediocrity. 

> COVID triggered a rush to remote work, and proponents quickly prophesied a remote-only future in which everyone lives and works from anywhere -- the Peak of Inflated Expectations. 

[The Slow Death of the Firm](https://thecontrol.co/the-slow-death-of-the-firm-1bd6cc81286b) by Nick Tomaino

> Most people think of Bitcoin as a digital asset, but it can be thought of as something more general than that: a decentralized organization.

> This new organizational structure has resulted in [more than $500B](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) worth of value creation (today the total market value of Bitcoin is now larger than the market capitalization of Goldman Sachs).

[The Nature of the Firm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x) by Ronald Coase

- Ronald Coase wrote about the firm’s ability to minimize transaction costs in 1937


## Blockchain/DeFi

[Own the Internet - A Bull Case for Ethereum](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet) by Packy McCormick

> It’s one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto. 

> Bitcoin is easy. It’s digital gold. It’s a Store of Value (SoV). It just kind of sits there. 

> Ethereum is so much more than a cryptocurrency. It’s a “world computer,” and the “value layer” of the internet. It lets people build apps and products with money baked into the code. 

[The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) by Packy McCormick

> DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

> DAOs sit a level above NFTs -- DAOs can own NFTs and create NFTs, plus do a whole lot of other non-NFT things -- and have more transformative potential than NFTs. 

[Blockchain Can Wrest the Internet From Corporations' Grasp](https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/)

> It's time to restore the open source, community-led ethos of the original internet—with crypto.

> From the mid 2000s to the present, trust in open protocols was replaced by trust in corporate management teams

> As companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook built software and services that surpassed the capabilities of open protocols, users migrated to these more sophisticated platforms.



## Metaverse

[The Value Chain of the Open Metaverse](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-value-chain-of-the-open-metaverse) by Packy McCormick

> If one central company gains control of this, they will become more powerful than any government and be a god on Earth. - Tim Sweeney, CEO, Epic Games

> “Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.” - Chris Dixon

[Power to the Person - The Creator Economy, NFTs, and the Rise of the Solo Corporation](https://www.notboring.co/p/power-to-the-person)

> The Creator Economy and NFTs are massive human potential unlocks. Even if certain assets are in a short-term bubble, we are on an inexorable march towards individuals mattering more than institutions. 

> We’re on the precipice of a creative explosion, fueled by putting power, and the ability to generate wealth, in the hands of the people.
