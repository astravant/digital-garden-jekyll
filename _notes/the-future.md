title: The Future
---

The future is going to be different than the present, but it will be rooted in the present. I look at the future as a set of potential paths, each with a different probability of becoming reality based on our actions as a society and individually. Below are the industries, trends, and topics I am most excited about in the coming decades.

## Longevity 


## Space



## Education



## Future of Work



## Mental Health



## Artifical Intelligence/Machine Learning
