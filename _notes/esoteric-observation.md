title: Esoteric Observation

### idea: history repeats itself

- I have been pondering a realization for some time. 
- As I began practicing mediation and having profound transcendental experiences I learned to observe how history repeats itself. 
- In that, beliefs seen by the masses as 'esoteric' or 'unbelievable' for centuries are now being proven with modern day science. 
- Such as the connectedness of the universe, source energy, quantum biology/physics, etc.

- Maybe the ancients were onto something?
