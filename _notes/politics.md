Title: On Politics
---

I have no significant interest in politics, nor have I for some time. I believe the system to be inherently corrupt - as once you politicize a system you will see the narcissistic and egotistical individuals filter to the top. They will act in accordance with self interest, not altruism.

Politics, just as capitalism or any other political, economic, or social structure, is not an organic system - these are human-made and designed.
