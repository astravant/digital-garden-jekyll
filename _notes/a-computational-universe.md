Title: A Computational Universe

_History is the story of information becoming aware of itself._

TLDR
The Universe is a cosmic information processing system, and its prime objective is evolution. The supreme value of the system is information. The Universe rewards systems that maximize the flow of information and punishes those that prevent it. Humans develop coordination vehicles i.e., nations, religions, corporations, etc. to work collectively towards common goals. Digital Nations are the next path forward in large-scale cooperation and coordination. The prime objective with ** is to create a Digital Nation that will enable coordination on a large enough scale so we can begin to work collectively towards common goals. *** will provide economic utility via a blockchain-based crowdsourcing system as the on-ramp to new economic, political, and social structures. The vision is to build a ‘work computer’ that acts as a distributed brain for organizing tasks, talent, contracts, records, and more for organizations and DAO’s. 

Something radically new is in the air: new ways of understanding physical systems, new ways of thinking about thinking that call into question many of our basic assumptions.

In the beginning God created information. Information existed, but it was without form – it had no awareness or understanding of its own existence. Gradually, information started to generate complexity on many scales: from molecules to cells to organs; from individual organisms up through economies, politics, cultures, and civilizations—and out even further into an astronomically large computational universe made up of billions upon billions of galaxies with trillions upon trillions of stars. 

Information is something like magic. It determines how well economies grow or fail, which genes are turned on or off, it makes some technologies possible while blocking others—whether those technologies are "life changing" or just trivial. Information shapes our understanding of ourselves and how we relate to each other, it defines who we are as a species. Yet for all its power, information remains a mystery: Information is scattered, inconsistent, and incomplete.

One thing is clear: nature rewards systems that maximize the flow of information.
