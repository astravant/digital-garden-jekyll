Title: A Computational Universe

# A Computational Universe

In the beginning God created information. Information existed, but it was without form – it had no awareness or understanding of its own existence. But that all changed when information became aware of itself. Information started to generate complexity on many scales: from molecules to cells to organs; from individual organisms up through economies, politics, cultures, and civilizations themselves—and out even further into an astronomically large computational universe made up of billions upon billions of galaxies with trillions upon trillions of stars.

History is the story of information becoming aware of itself. It is the story of how knowledge, which began as simple information processing in organisms, became self-aware and gained the power to create itself. Generate more of itself, create meaning.

Information is something like magic in itself – with consequences more extraordinary than any illusion or trick can ever be. It determines how well economies grow or fail, which genes are turned on or off, it makes some technologies possible while blocking others—whether those technologies are "life changing" or just trivial.

Information shapes our understanding of ourselves and how we relate to each other, it defines who we are as a species. Where we are now and where we are headed.

Information is the currency of the Information Age.

Yet for all its power, information remains a mystery: Information is scattered, inconsistent, and incomplete.

The types of information we create and consume will determine the future.

Information is not new. What is new is the way we process and share information today. The more connected we become, the faster ideas spread, and the more sophisticated our tools for manipulating information become, the more we can connect.

Nature rewards systems which maximize the flow of information.
