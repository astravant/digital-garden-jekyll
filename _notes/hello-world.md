### Welcome!

Welcome to my website. You are reading the first post in this digital garden.

### The Beginning

The practice of sitting down to write is far from a new endavor for me, but I am excited to begin sharing my thoughts more openly. The following notes (always being edited and updated) are a culmination of years of jounral entries, essays, notes, and voice memos I have extrapolated into succint text to be placed in this digital garden.

This project began with a simple idea of condensing some of the greatest learnings and [[mental models]] from my life into a single document to reference in the coming years. 


### Let there be light

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes

### Images and other Markdown goodies

Finally, because you have the full power of Markdown in this template, you can use regular Markdown syntax for various formatting options.

Lists work as expected:

- List element A
- List element B
- List element C

1. List element
2. List element
3. List element

So do code blocks, with full syntax highlighting:

```js
// Here's a bit of JavaScript:
console.log('hello!')
```

If you'd like to quote other people, consider using quote blocks:

> You can't use up creativity. The more you use the more you have.

And of course, images look great:

### Next steps


Go forth, have fun, and learn new something every day! ✌️
