### Welcome!

Welcome to my website. You are reading the first post in this digital garden.

### The Beginning

The practice of sitting down to write is far from a new endavor for me, but I am excited to begin sharing my thoughts more openly. The following notes (always being edited and updated) are a culmination of years of journal entries, essays, notes, and voice memos I have extrapolated into succint text to be placed in this digital garden.

This project began with the simple idea of condensing some of the greatest learnings and [[mental models]] from my life into a single document to reference in the coming years. 

In the past, I have not published much of my writing due to the feeling that I needed to edit and perfect it before I published it. The reason I like the idea of a digital garden is because it removes that filter. I can write about what is on my mind at any particular moment and just publish it. I don't have to worry if it's 'up to par' or good enough. For me, a digital garden is a great way to spread half-baked ideas that you're still thinking through internally. The goal of this space is to offer a portal into my mind and hopefully share some valubale insights for readers.

Go forth, have fun, and learn new something every day! ✌️
