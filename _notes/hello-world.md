### Welcome!

You are reading the first post in this digital garden.

### The Beginning

The practice of sitting down to write is far from a new endavor for me, but I am excited to begin sharing my thoughts more openly. The following notes (always being edited and updated) are a culmination of years of journal entries, essays, and voice memos I have extrapolated into succint text to be placed in this digital garden.

This project began with the simple idea of condensing some of the greatest learnings and [[mental models]] from my life into a single document to reference in the coming years. 

Hopefully, over the years it will evolve into a personal 'wiki' of sorts. 

> You can't use up creativity. The more you use the more you have.


Go forth, have fun, and learn new something every day! ✌️
