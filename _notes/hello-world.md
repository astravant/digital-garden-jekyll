### Welcome!

You are reading the first post in this digital garden.

The practice of sitting down to write is far from a new endeavor for me, but I am excited to begin sharing my thoughts more openly. The following notes (always being edited and updated) are a culmination of years of journal entries, essays, and voice memos I have extrapolated into succinct text. The idea is to put into text all of the major lessons I have learned from my experiences and to share notable articles and books that others may find useful. Hopefully, over the years it will evolve into a personal 'wiki' of sorts.

I have been doing some thinking about how long-form content should be written. There are many different schools of thought on the topic, but ultimately I chose to focus on 'digital gardens.' [A garden is a collection of evolving ideas](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.

You will find observations and essays on startups, technology, philosophy, productivity, and more. 

> Look for how things flow, ask how they can flow better.
