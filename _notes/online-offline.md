title: Online vs. Offline

### idea: A contrarian outlook on the age of social media - building offline connections are more important than online connections. 
- this idea ties into Reid Hoffman's idea of the [darknet](https://www.incognitoartists.com/blog/power-dark-net/).
- darknet = information that is not searchable online, in any book, in any classroom, and never will be
  - people will share ideas and thoughts they would not share online 
-  plus, while offline you are able to ask very specific questions derived from your current situation which lead to better answers. 

### idea: 1 great contact is worth 100 mediocre contacts  
- this ties into the idea of social media and the over saturation of individuals utilizing social. 
- Focusing on building offline relationships and investing time into getting that ONE connection i.e. someone who is top of their field, well-connected, billionaire, etc. 
- This person can be all you need as they connect you to their network. 
- One solid contact can turn into a whole network of well respected people 

### idea: I believe public figures have convinced many people to use social media whose personality types don't match up with this vertical 
- people who are better suited for building and creating behind the scenes. 
- if you and I are competing with one another in similar industries or verticals and you spend 50% of your time on social and the other half on your biz, I will win 7 days of the week as I have 100% invested into the biz
### counterargument 
- there are certainly some positives. Having a loyal following can help scale your biz. 
- But, to a point. If you look at some of the most successful influencers in the world like Kylie Jenner, she built a $1B biz in a few years. 
- And, a biz that did not have too much social impact. 
- So, if you are interested in building a company that changes the social fabric and how the world operates i.e. millions or billions of users and $10B+ - it is better to focus on building the product vs. social in the near term
- social may play a role at some point in the life cycle. 
- also idea of personal brand vs corporate brand
