Title: The Universal Algorithm
---

My research and exploration into the underlying principles of the universe continue to point me towards the same conclusion. The universe and the human mind are just advanced algorithms; they’re crunching and processing information all the time. If you learn to understand the algorithms and what they’re working for (and towards), you have the power to hack the system and receive virtually anything you want.

Evolution is the Answer

Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe. It is the only constant, and it drives everything. When you understand this, and see the human mind as an advanced algorithm, you can align your incentives with that of the Whole to get virtually anything you want.

Ask: How can you help make the algorithm more efficient and effective? Read: How can you help simplify and/or accelerate the flow of information, data, currency, information, resources, etc.?

### We Have Forgotten the Truth

We live in societies that place considerable value on the material and physical, societies that value expression through materialism. We have become infatuated with looking a certain way and speaking a certain way. We have been conditioned from birth to desire objects and luxuries, we yearn for success because of how we think it will make us feel. Because of how we think we’ll be perceived by others once we get ‘the thing.’ We are more focused on looking than being. We live our lives in pursuit of illusions, constructs of the human mind.

This has created what I call the ‘Era of the Lie,’ millions live their lives based on lies – we imagine ourselves in roles that differ from reality. We create these illusions to appear in a group of higher social status. We live in our own fictionalized, delusional, subjective worlds. Look around, all you see are constructs of the human mind, we see what people want us to see. People are far more complicated than the masks they wear in public. Never become distracted by people’s glamorous portraits of themselves and their lives – they have insecurities just like you or me.

> The tendency to live a life that satisfies momentary desires is the greatest enemy of progress. - Jordan Peterson

This endless pursuit of the physical and material has given birth to over-active minds, most of us are in our minds only. Over time, our sense of self and identity become very strong and defined. We define ourselves as a particular person who is unable to change. We are our minds – we are our bodies. But, we are not our minds or our bodies – these things are simply tools and vehicles we must utilize.

From now on, think of yourself as a machine operating within a system and know you have the ability to alter your machine to produce better outcomes.

### How Did We Get Here

Now, there are both evolutionary and practical explanations to these phenomenon and paradigms.

First, human beings are social animals – we are wired to connect and reliant upon this connection to survive and thrive (humans are not special in this way, it is hard to think of any animal for whom social behavior is not important). Fitting in, being accepted, and following the group and status quo are all inherent to human nature. Therefore, when a collective group or culture begins to believe a thing or act a certain way, we tend to follow.

The historian and philosopher René Girard postulated a theory called the “Theory of Mimetic Desire.” It stated that human beings don’t know what they want so they imitate each other, and this gives rise to rivalries and conflicts. Since we also imitate desires, we begin to desire the same things, so we easily become rivals as we are reaching for the same objects.

Ask yourself why you seek what you do, desire what you do, work towards what you do – where do these desires come from? Do you really need the thing or do you want it because of how you think it will make you feel? Change the way others perceive you?

The practical answer to why we have become so focused on materialism – the government and social structures would collapse without their citizens’ pursuit of materialism. A focus on the material and physical is absolutely necessary. We continue to be dutiful servants to the system, output at all costs – and we ask no questions because we are lost in our own minds. Growth is always the answer.

We seek happiness and pleasure through biochemicals. Drugs, SSRIs, antidepressants, etc. While governments pledge to crackdown on drugs that allegedly disrupt social order (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT) they endorse drugs via the FDA that maintain social order (Prozac, Zoloft, Adderall). Drugs that keep you working and focused on the material are endorsed. Drugs that expand your awareness and consciousness are illegal.

For every new desire, we are signing a contract with the universe to suffer.
