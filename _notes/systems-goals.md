title: Systems vs. Goals

Via Scott Adams profile in Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss 

### Idea = it is more important to focus on skill development and systems than goals. 

Why? 

Goals are binary - pass/fail, yes/no - they are bad indicators of success 

Whereas if you are choosing projects based on where you will learn the most and develop the most as a person - you will be much more successful in the long run. 

### Exercise

When choosing projects...

Ask: what is your long term objective/vision? 

What skills are required to accomplish these objectives? 

Choose the project where you will acquire the most important of these skills.

It's not just about acquiring skills - it's about acquiring the skills that are right for you. Given your objectives and goals. 

### Ask: what project will teach me the most? (Not just the one that will earn you the most)
