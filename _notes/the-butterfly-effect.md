Title: The Butterfly Effect
--- 
I have a strong belief that it is our duty to share ideas, and concepts that we have in our head with the world. It is our duty and obligation.  Every decision that you make in turn has an impact on the ones around you.

Working for your brother and sister, is working for yourself. We move as one. Manifest for others before you manifest for yourself. It’s like basing decisions off of the whole. The universe is one community, one family, one soul. If you begin to look at the world this way - it will change your life. There is no more us against them or me against this person. Acting for yourself is acting for the whole. Acting for the common good is helping yourself. We were born to work in cooperation with each other, not against each other. To work in opposition with one another is to work against nature.

The path you are meant to take you will have to fight to create. The stars will never align. We have this idea that one day we’re going to do it, follow the dream, start the business - that never happens. Start now - momentum will carry you.

It is a sin to not share the ideas you have in your head with the world.
