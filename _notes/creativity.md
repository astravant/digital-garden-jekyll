> The creative process is the act of making new connections between old ideas or recognizing relationships between concepts.

> While we often think of creativity as an event or as a natural skill that some people have and some don't, research actually suggests that both creativity and non-creativity are learned.

> In any creative endeavor, you have to give yourself permission to create junk.

[The Science of Creativity](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity)

> Take on projects that don't necessarily have a solution...This causes old ideas to compete, which helps generate new ones.

> Surround yourself with interesting things and people

> Keep an idea notebook or voice recorder with you, type in new thoughts on your laptop or write ideas down on a napkin.

> ...research has suggested that creative imagination can also be boosted through our environment or simply putting in lots of hard work.
