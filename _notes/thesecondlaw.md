Title: The 2ND Law

Entropy is always lurking. It is the second law of thermodynamics after all, and one that seems inherently inevitable - the second you order something into being, it starts to fall apart. We are constantly fighting against entropy with everything from human striving to life itself.

In a physical system, information is the opposite of entropy, as it involves uncommon and highly correlated configurations that are difficult to arrive at.

We have more power than ever before over information--that is what makes this moment so exciting. But with great power comes great responsibility: without a careful eye towards how all these changes will affect society at every level from individuals (ourselves) up through regional economies down to microbes; there might be unintended negative consequences that cannot just be undone by switching some toggle back again.

The ultimate purpose of life, mind and human striving: to deploy energy and information in such a way as to fight back the tide of entropy.

We must design new systems that increase the flow and increase the output of information

We must look at how things flow and ask how they can flow better.

The ultimate product of the human mind is creativity and invention.
