Title: On Competition
---

If your mission and purpose are really important to you, you should not care how they are reached. Meaning, do not get attached to one idea over another because of your emotions or because you have put more time into it. If you really are driven by a purpose and you mean it, why does it matter if you receive equity and recognition if the goal in the end is still accomplished?

We must remove ourselves from the situation and look at how the end goal will best be achieved, not letting our egos get in the way. Focus on the mission, not the idea.

We currently live in a Game A system - in this system you are objectively 'rewarded' for pursuing domination, wealth, control, power, market share (insert any Game A vector). Also, competition and rivalry is innate to human biology - there is no reason to feel guilty for pursuing wealth and success.

So much fear and doubt - resulting in procrastination - exists in my life because I am a proponent of decentralization and power to the people so I want to work on projects which insert these ideas and types of ventures at a societal scale. But, as I am learning, it is difficult in today's world to reach a critical mass of people with these ideas.
