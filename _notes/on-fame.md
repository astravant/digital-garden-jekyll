title: On Fame
---

#### What the ego pursues has been conditioned, the ego is not genetic. It has been programmed. 
Growing up I thought it might be fun or fulfilling to have a level of fame and be known by lots of people. The more I reflect, the more miserable it sounds. I feel more inclined to build organizations that truly help people and change the world - not in pursuit of material wealth or notoriety, but simply for the feeling and process of having done it and the positive impact it will create. To take an abstract idea and turn it into reality and help people in the process. 

- similar to my [[Online vs. Offline]] theory 
	- if you look at some of the most revered humans, they were not putting themselves into the public spotlight all of the time
	- the closer you get to the myth, the quicker it fades away
	- being on social goes well for very few people 
	- it ruins the myth - I want to build an aura, a mystique 
	- few of the people I want to be connected with use social media
