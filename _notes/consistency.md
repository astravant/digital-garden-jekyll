title: Consistency is Key

Show up. Do the work. Be consistent.

Do something every day to make progress towards your goals.

The universe rewards focus and dedication. It is not up to us to decide if something is possible or impossible. That is up to the universe to decide. All we need to do is have the vision and dedication and courage to follow it.
