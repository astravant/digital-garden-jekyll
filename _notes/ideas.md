## Virutal Inception

Do we live more in virtual worlds in the future?
- re: Daniel Sch. in Eric Weinstein podcast: is there an inverse correlation currency value in the digital world vs. the physical world

We will begin moving more and more of our lives to the virtual world just as we have done with the internet as access to new tools and technologies have been democratized.

- re: website "we believe every human will need an avatar to represent themselves as the lines between the physical and digital worlds become increasingly blurred."
- "avatars have the power to forge authentic connections that in turn help build real communities."
- As the next generation of consumers spend increasingly more of their lives in some form of a digital realm, 3D avatars will likely be everywhere.
- Avatars are the next medium of expression, and 3D allows you to effectively operate and command virtual beings.

## Biocentrism
- Concepts such as time, space, and even causality are increasingly being demonstrated as meaningless.
- All of science is based on information passing through our consciousness but science hasn’t the foggiest idea what consciousness is, and it can’t explain the linkage between subatomic states and observation by conscious observers. 
- Science describes life as a random occurrence in a dead universe but has no real understanding of how life began or why the universe appears to be exquisitely designed for the emergence of life.

## Future Thoughts
- The future is going to be different than the present, but it will be rooted in the present. The future can be seen as a set of potential outcomes, each with a different probability of becoming base reality based on our actions as a society and individually. 
- Some potential paths - an AI controlled human race or a distributed, decentralized future. 
- Idea: you walk into what is essentially a phone booth (portal) and your consciousness is transported to a bio-mechanical entity in your “living room” in Alaska or on Mars
- The future of work will consist of creative thought and humans will work in conjunction with machines to execute strategies for delivering the fruits of an idea.
- We need to get more people working on the sciences and building a world that works for more of humanity. We must free up the world to work on the conversion problems that exist. Working for others is working for yourself. 

## Random
- Very important to recognize the motives driving the actions of individuals and society
- Be willing to take a different path - reverse engineer your desires and motives to get at the root of what really interests you and what you believe is important to the future of humanity and invest time and energy every day towards building this as your form of creative expression. 
- accept that the path for you will likely be dissimilar to the path pursued by the masses
- the path being followed by the masses is not always the right path, find the right path for you. 
- compare yourself to where you were yesterday, not to where someone else is today. 

- Too many of our smartest minds are working on trivial tasks and spending their time in corporations where they feel invisible.

## Autonomous Driving
- The industry will likely submit to natural geographic monoplies due to the amount of location-specific driving data necessary to launch and have a winning platform. 
- first movers will be able to collect more data thus increasing the likliehood of having a better platform.

## Estonia
- Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation with a population of only ~1.3 million people, is considered one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.

- [The first country to launch a Digital Nomad Visa](https://www.etiasvisa.com/etias-news/digital-nomad-visas-eu-countries)
- The first country to offer digital residency to non-Estonians living anywhere in world
- The first country to hold nationwide elections using electronic voting 
- The first country that Ikea first entered digitally before establishing a physical presence

## Evolution

- if you are not growing, you are dying. 
- If you want something to become stronger - you must challenge it. 
- Just as how pain and suffering build character 

I see so much of our generation focusing on low hanging fruit because they are being driven by ego and seeking validation. Focus on 50 years from now, not 50 days from now. 
	
  - low barrier to entry means lots of competition 
  - go after world-class, the top, most people think they cannot get that far so they settle for being mediocre and in the middle.
  - We are making it increasingly difficult for ourselves to evolve. We are our own worst enemy. We use our creativity to adapt and change our environments. Are we slowing down evolution or speeding it up?
