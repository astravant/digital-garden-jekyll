## Virutal Inception

Do we live more in virtual worlds in the future?
- re: Daniel Sch. in Eric Weinstein podcast: is there an inverse correlation currency value in the digital world vs. the physical world

We will begin moving more and more of our lives to the virtual world just as we have done with the internet as access to new tools and technologies have been democratized.

- re: website "we believe every human will need an avatar to represent themselves as the lines between the physical and digital worlds become increasingly blurred."
- "avatars have the power to forge authentic connections that in turn help build real communities."
- As the next generation of consumers spend increasingly more of their lives in some form of a digital realm, 3D avatars will likely be everywhere.
- Avatars are the next medium of expression, and 3D allows you to effectively operate and command virtual beings.

- the idea of a [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse)

## Biocentrism
- Concepts such as time, space, and even causality are increasingly being demonstrated as meaningless.
- All of science is based on information passing through our consciousness but science hasn’t the foggiest idea what consciousness is, and it can’t explain the linkage between subatomic states and observation by conscious observers. 
- Science describes life as a random occurrence in a dead universe but has no real understanding of how life began or why the universe appears to be exquisitely designed for the emergence of life.

## Random
- Very important to recognize the motives driving the actions of individuals and society
- Be willing to take a different path - reverse engineer your desires and motives to get at the root of what really interests you and what you believe is important to the future of humanity and invest time and energy every day towards building this as your form of creative expression. 
- accept that the path for you will likely be dissimilar to the path pursued by the masses
- the path being followed by the masses is not always the right path, find the right path for you. 
- compare yourself to where you were yesterday, not to where someone else is today. 

- Too many of our smartest minds are working on trivial tasks and spending their time in corporations where they feel invisible.
- Looking like you're being productive is often a better strategy for career advancement than actually being productive.

## Autonomous Driving
-  industry will likely submit to natural geographic monoplies due to the amount of location-specific driving data necessary to launch and have a winning platform. 
- first movers will be able to collect more data thus increasing the likliehood of having a better platform. 
- Nio = tesla of China
	- stock up 700% in 2020
	
## Estonia
- Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation with a population of only ~1.3 million people, is considered one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.
- The world’s first e-government
- The first country to launch a Digital Nomad Visa
- The first country to offer digital residency to non-Estonians living anywhere in world
- The first country to hold nationwide elections using electronic voting 
- The first country that Ikea first entered digitally before establishing a physical presence

## Passing a Law

- How does a bill become law? 
	- every law starts with an idea- contact elected officials to share the idea
	- if they like the idea, they will write a bill
	- A bill can start in either house of congress when it's introduced by its primary sponsor -- a senator or representative 
	- Representatives or senators meet in a small group to research, talk about, and make changes to the bill before sending it to: 
	- the House of Senate floor for debate or to a subcommittee for further research. 
	- Congress debates and votes
	- Both houses have to agree on the same version of the final bill before it goes to the President.

- taxpayers can see where the money is going 
- a percentage of taxes can be given to organizations of the taxpayers choice

## Evolution

- if you are not growing, you are dying. 
- I fear we may be dying
- If you want something to become stronger - you must challenge it. 
- Just as how pain and suffering build character 

I see so much of our generation focusing on low hanging fruit because they are being driven by ego and seeking validation. Focus on 50 years from now, not 50 days from now. 
	
  - low barrier to entry means lots of competition 
  - go after world-class, the top, most people think they cannot get that far so they settle for being mediocre and in the middle.
  - We are making it increasingly difficult for ourselves to evolve. We are our own worst enemy. We use our creativity to adapt and change our environments. Are we slowing down evolution or speeding it up?
