## Virutal Inception

Do we live more in virtual worlds in the future?
- re: Daniel Sch. in Eric Weinstein podcast: is there an inverse correlation currency value in the digital world vs. the physical world

We will begin moving more and more of our lives to the virtual world just as we have done with the internet as access to new tools and technologies have been democratized.

- re: website "we believe every human will need an avatar to represent themselves as the lines between the physical and digital worlds become increasingly blurred."
- "avatars have the power to forge authentic connections that in turn help build real communities."
- As the next generation of consumers spend increasingly more of their lives in some form of a digital realm, 3D avatars will likely be everywhere.
- Avatars are the next medium of expression, and 3D allows you to effectively operate and command virtual beings.

## Passing a Law

- How does a bill become law? 
	- every law starts with an idea- contact elected officials to share the idea
	- if they like the idea, they will write a bill
	- A bill can start in either house of congress when it's introduced by its primary sponsor -- a senator or representative 
	- Representatives or senators meet in a small group to research, talk about, and make changes to the bill before sending it to: 
	- the House of Senate floor for debate or to a subcommittee for further research. 
	- Congress debates and votes
	- Both houses have to agree on the same version of the final bill before it goes to the President.

## Evolution

- if you are not growing, you are dying. 
- I fear we may be dying
- If you want something to become stronger - you must challenge it. 
- Just as how pain and suffering build character 

I see so much of our generation focusing on low hanging fruit because they are being driven by ego and seeking validation. Focus on 50 years from now, not 50 days from now. 
	
  - low barrier to entry means lots of competition 
  - go after world-class, the top, most people think they cannot get that far so they settle for being mediocre and in the middle.
  - We are making it increasingly difficult for ourselves to evolve. We are our own worst enemy. We use our creativity to adapt and change our environments. Are we slowing down evolution or speeding it up?
