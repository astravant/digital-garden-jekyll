I see so much of our generation focusing on low hanging fruit because they are being driven by ego and seeking validation. Focus on 50 years from now, not 50 days from now. 
	
  - low barrier to entry means lots of competition 
  - go after world-class, the top, most people think they cannot get that far so they settle for being mediocre and in the middle 
  - We are making it increasingly difficult for ourselves to evolve. We are our own worst enemy. We use our creativity to adapt and change our environments. Are we slowing down evolution or speeding it up?
