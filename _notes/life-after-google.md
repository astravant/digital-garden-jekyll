title: Life After Google by George Gilder
--- 

This book focuses on the age of Google coming to an end as the architecture of the  blockchain model and its derivatives usher in a new era.

Google’s broad scope of knowledge centers around big data.

They gather all the information into one central place, which they call the cloud. Once the information is all together, their system analyzes it using sophisticated algorithms to extract new information.

Google constructed an enormous database of information – a digital rendering of the real world. beginning with the internet and expanding to include books, languages, maps and even faces. **The problem is since Google wants access to all information, any privacy runs contrary to its model.**

We can realize a **new age of online security with technologies such as bitcoin and blockchain.**

“Instead of putting power in the hands of individuals, The Internet, under Google’s influence has become a porous cloud where all the money and power rise to the top.” 

“‘The economy has arrived at a point where it produces enough in principle for everyone… So this new period we are entering is not so much about production anymore — how much is produced; it is about distribution — how people get a share in what is produced.’ — W. Brian Arthur, Santa Fe Institute, 2017”

“All wealth is the product of knowledge.”

“Google is hierarchical. Life after Google will be heterarchical, Google is top-down. Life after Google will be bottom-up. Google rules by the insecurity of all the lower layers in the stack. A porous stack enables the money and power to be sucked up to the top. In life after Google, a secure ground state in the individual human being, registered and timestamped in a digital ledger, will prevent this suction of hierarchical power… Whereas Google now controls your information and uses it free of charge, you will be master of your own information and charge for it freely. Try the brave Browser of Brendan Eich, formerly of Mozilla and the author of Javascript. It gives you power over your data and enables you to charge for them.” (p.48)

As Caltech’s Carver Mead tells us, “listen to the technology and find out what it is telling us.”

“As Peter Drucker said, “It is less important to do things right than to do the right things” Effectiveness is more important than efficiency.
