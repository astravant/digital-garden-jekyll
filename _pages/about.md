We are pursuing labels, constructs of the human mind.

Labels do not matter - they are simply words society has attached a particular value to. We believe once we have achieved X we will benefit from a sense of gratification 


The two things we have in this life are *time* and *energy.*

I believe all we have in this world are time and energy and the agency to choose how we invest these two valuable resources. The projects we embark on differ based on which period in time we are alive, what does not waver is the human experince. The ability to invest time and energy. Choose wisely. 

What if society valued creation, innovation, sharing?
