We are pursuing labels, constructs of the human mind.

> Best-Selling Author, CEO, Activist, Billionaire, Philanthropist, Public Figure

These are simply words society has attached particular values to - do not chase labels.

The most valuable resources we have in this life are *time* and *energy* and the agency to choose how we invest them.

I believe all we have in this world are time and energy and the agency to choose how we invest these two valuable resources. The projects we embark on differ based on which period in time we are alive, what does not waver is the human experince. The ability to invest time and energy. Choose wisely. 

What if society valued creation, innovation, sharing?
