We are pursuing labels, constructs of the human mind.

> Best-Selling Author, CEO, Activist, Billionaire, Philanthropist, Public Figure

These are simply words society has attached particular values to - do not chase labels.

The most valuable resources we have in this life are *time* and *energy* and the agency to choose how we invest them.

The projects we embark on vary based on which time period we are living in, what does not change is the human experience. The ability to choose how you invest your time and energy. Choose wisely.

What if society valued creation, innovation, sharing?
