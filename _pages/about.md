We are pursuing labels, constructs of the human mind.

> Best-Selling Author, CEO, Activist, Millionaire, Philanthropist, Public Figure

These are simply words society has attached particular values to - do not chase labels.

The most valuable resources we have in this life are *time* and *energy* and the agency to choose how/what we invest these into.

The projects and topics I choose to invest my time and energy into include: artifical intelligence, biotechnology, blockchain, data science, future of work/education, philosophy, science fiction, social engineering, and others.  

These are much better indicators of who I am than *serial entrepreneur, writer, investor, or futurist*
