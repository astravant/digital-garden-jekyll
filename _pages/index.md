# ‚ÄúCuriouser and curiouser!‚Äù

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Hello World]]</span> to get started on your exploration. Have fun!
</p>

Welcome to a digital garden! This is my online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog. A multi-year project of information sensemaking. Generally speaking, this space will discuss thoughts on startups, technology, philosophy, and productivity. It will use bi-directional linking - a lot of internal links - to connect notes together. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/brandonspiess) üëã

The best way to get started on understanding digital gardens is to read this [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/).

Additional reading on digital gardens:

- [How the Blog Broke the Web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) by Amy Hoy
- [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) by Joel Hooks
- [The Swale: Weaving between Garden and Stream](https://bonkerfield.org/2020/05/swale-garden-stream/) by Will Stedden

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

The objective of this digital garden is a multi-year project to curate, connect, and explore knowledge. It also provides a way to reflect on past experiences while learning new things at the same time.

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Here are the most recent <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Daily Notes]]</span> to get a feel for the space.
