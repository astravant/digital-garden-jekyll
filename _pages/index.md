Welcome to a digital garden! An online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog. A project of information sensemaking. Generally speaking, this digital garden will share thoughts on startups, technology, philosophy, personal development, and future predictions. I will use bi-directional linking -a lot of internal links- to connect notes together.

The best way to get started on understanding digital gardens is to read this [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/).
