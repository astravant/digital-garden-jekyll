  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Hello World]]</span> to get started on your exploration. Have fun!
</p>

Welcome to a digital garden! This is my online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog. A multi-year project of information sensemaking. Generally speaking, this space will discuss thoughts on technology, productivity, philosophy, and startups. It will use bi-directional linking - a lot of internal links - to connect notes together. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/brandonspiess) ðŸ‘‹

The best way to get started on understanding digital gardens is to read this [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/).

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

For me, writing has made a huge difference in learning, reflecting, peace of mind, and worldview expansion. The objective of this digital garden is a decades-spanning public project to curate, connect, and explore knowledge. I'm excited to begin sharing thoughts and observations more publicly.

  Here are my most recent <span style="font-weight: bold">[[ideas]]</span> to get a feel for the space.
